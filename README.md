Welcome to the home page of my pet project - Quack Graphics Engine.

**Currently it's in early WIP stage and much more need to do. Also you can find little weird code solutions here.**

You can check out OpenGL branch (master) and Vulkan branch (vulkan).

Engine dependencies are not provided by the repo. You must clone them to the CMakeLists build files related folders or change paths manually. Here is the list of them:
- Assimp
- EnTT
- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM
- ImGui
- STB
- spdlog
- Yaml
- ImGuizmo

The engine was built under `ubuntu 22.04` using `gcc 12.2.0`. You also might need to set up your workspace to compile Vulkan and deps code. All necessary packages will be provided here later.
