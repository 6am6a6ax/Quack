Welcome to the home page of my pet project - Quack Graphics Engine.

**Currently it's in the early WIP stage and much more needs to be done. Also you can find little weird code solutions here.**

You can check out the OpenGL branch (master) and Vulkan branch (vulkan).

To prepare your workspace to build and run the engine and its tools you need to execute `deployment.sh` script.

The engine was built and tested under `ubuntu 22.04` using `gcc 12.2.0`.

Here is the full list of the engine dependencies:
- Assimp
- EnTT
- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM
- ImGui
- STB
- spdlog
- Yaml
- ImGuizmo
